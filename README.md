# Nugget for Web

Nugget is a web application where you can add and manage nuggets of wisdom.

It shows a Mental Model of the Day, which takes a mental model from a RESTful API I built, check it out [here](https://github.com/anahv/Mental-Models-API) 

**Coming soon**: get a text message to remind you of a random nugget you saved, using Twilio.
